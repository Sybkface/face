Laughing at me for nothing.
Trying to shame me, without even understanding the situation.

I suffer from serious depression at the moment, and yall knew it, and instead of offering some help like any normal human would do, yall decided to make fun out of it.
You are truly great people, 👍 and surely good friends to have, you cant even help out a person.

You have no hearts, no brain, no understanding. You are not humans, you are idiots that tried to ruin someone's life. All this meant nothing to you, but meant a lot to me 👍">
